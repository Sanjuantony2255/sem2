1.What is Matplotlib?

Matplotlib is a Python library for creating visualizations of data. It provides tools for creating a wide range of static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python, including line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and more.

2.How do you create a basic plot in Matplotlib?

Import the Matplotlib library using import matplotlib.pyplot as plt . Use the plot function to plot some data.

3.How do you customize a plot in Matplotlib?

Changing the axis labels and plot title
Changing the color and style of the plot
Adding a legend

4.How do you create a scatter plot in Matplotlib?

To create a scatter plot in Matplotlib,use the scatter function.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [2, 4, 6]

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()

This will create a scatter plot with the data points (1, 2), (2, 4), and (3, 6).

9.What is a subplot in Matplotlib?

subplots() is a powerful function in Python that allows users to create a grid of subplots within a single figure. 
This function is a part of the Matplotlib library, which is widely used for data visualization in Python.

10.What does PIL do in Python?
